Get the Game ID by running the following command:

    kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} exec deployments/{{ .Release.Name }} -- sh -c 'echo "$(cat GameID.txt)"'

If this is the first time you are launching the server, do NOT share the game
ID until you have joined at least once! The first user to join will be made
an admin automatically.
